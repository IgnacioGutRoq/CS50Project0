    <h1>Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA)</h1>
    <h2>Multiplayer Online Battle Arena are games that had it's starts as modifications (or mods) to popular games from the late 90's and early 2000.</h2>
    <h4>History</h4>
    <h5>The first ever MOBA was from a 'mod' for Starcraft, a Real Time Strategy game from 1998, called Aeon of Strife, who was originaly a custom map for the game. The game consists in destroying the enemy base using a hero unit supported by weaker units, commonly called 'minions'. After the success of this Starcraft mod, Defense of the Ancients (DotA) appeared as a map mod for Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne, another Real Time Strategy game. DotA was one of the firsts MOBA mods to hold sponsored tournaments. It was followed by games like League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, Smite and a direct sequel: Dota 2. </h5>
