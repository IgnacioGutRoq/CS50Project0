# IgnacioGutRoq

Welcome to the Project 0 of CS50's WebProgramming with Python and Javascript. I'm Ignacio Gutiérrez.

This project is made oriented in videogames and their most popular generes. You can read if you want the descriptions in each of the pages.

The project includes 5 HTML pages: Index, FPS, MOBA, Familiar and RPG. Each of them has a description or history about the genere, a table or grid, at least one photo and a quick jump section with hyperlinks. Each genere's HTML has Bootstrap 4 added.

All the design of the pages are changed by a big CSS file, called "Styling.css". This is modified by a SCSS file, called "Sselector.scss", to make everything easier to change when needed using SASS. Some of the pages includes Inheritance and Nesting at different levels. Some id's are added at a grid made to show how good looks some numbers in red in a dark background.

Thanks for the opportunity given. Thanks to Brian Yu for his teachings.

Ignacio Gutiérrez.
