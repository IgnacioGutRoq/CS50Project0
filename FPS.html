<h1>First Person Shooters (FPS)</h1>
<h2>First person shooters are games oriented, as the name says, to use weapons while facing in a realistic way. A lot of gamers in the world plays this kind of games as a hobby, or as a profession.</h2>
<h4>History</h4>
<p><h5>FPS genere was introduced first as 2d scrollers that simulated a first person perspective in a pseudo 3D modeled environment. Games like Maze War (1973) were the first ones to show this 2D rendering to show some kind of 3D depth, giving the players the sensation of "walking on a digital world". The Shooting in the FPS genere started with the game "Phantom Slayer" (1982), who included vertex traced images and the ability to shoot projectiles to drawn enemies. From there, there was a group of very talented people, who forged the FPS genere in less than 5 years. "id Software", a company created in 1991 by John Carmack, John Romero, Tom Hall and Adrian Carmack, all of them ex-employees of Softdisk. This studio would become the father of the FPS genere as it is know nowadays, after the creation of "Wolfenstein 3D", in 1992. One year later, "id Software" released the game that was the most played in PC's history: "DOOM".</h5></p>
